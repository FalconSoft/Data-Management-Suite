## How to Install and Run FalconSoft Data Management Suite Server.

Ð¡onfigure the `FalconSoft.Data.Server.exe.config` file:

Find the section <appSettings>

```xml
  <appSettings>
    <add key="ConnectionString" value="http://localhost:8080/" />
    <add key="MetaDataPersistenceConnectionString" value="mongodb://localhost/rw_metadata" />
    <add key="PersistenceDataConnectionString" value="mongodb://localhost/rw_data" />
    <add key="MongoDataConnectionString" value="mongodb://localhost/MongoData" />
    <add key="CatalogDlls" value=".\DataSources\" />
  </appSettings>
```

   `Connection String` path to connect to server;
   
   `MetaDataPersistenceConnectionString`, `PersistenceDataConnectionString`, `MongoDataConnectionString` - path to DataBase tables;
   
   `CatalogDlls` - path to directory with your own dataSources. If you want to have an relative path you have to start path with `.\`. If you need to have more than one path you can separate if with `;` symbol;

   ```
   netsh http add urlacl url=http://+:8080/ user=machine\username
   ```
